Frostbite implemented with basic functionality. Those effects which are out of scope will not be worked on further. Currently in draft state while bugfixing in local repo.

Implemented:

cONFIRMED
    Animation
    Damage at turn end
    Spatt drop
    Shaymin forme change
    Ice type & Magma armor immunity

	PSYCHO SHIFT
	HYDRATION
	
lIKELY	
	Config
    Interactions with Guts, Quick Feet
    Increased Capture Chance
    Hydration fix
    Psycho shift
    Refresh and facade

Functioning: Shed skin, healer, misty terrain, comatose, aromatherapy, heal bell, safeguard, substitute, flower veil, healing wish, natural cure, marvel scale, lunar dance

Will need testing once battle can end without bug functional: pokemon centre healing, pc box healing, white out healing,
Needs implementation: Synchronise, Leaf Guard, Shields Down, Take Heart

Bugs:

    Frostbite symbol removed on levelup, switch out
    Game breaks on battle end if frostbite.
    Shed skin/hydration (effect 190) and healer (effect 310) refer to frostbite as "frozen" in message, otherwise functional (message needs modernisation anyway)
    Psycho shift (effect 118) functional but does not remove own status
    Secret power unaccounted for (complicated logic with table)
    Tri attack still freezing (complicated logic)
    Shaymin losing status on switch
    items not functioning (aspear, lum, ice heal, full restore, heal powder, sacred ash, full heal/local specialties [pewter crunchies, ragecandybar, lavacookie, old gateau, jubilife muffin, castelliacone, lumiose galette, big malasada, shalour sable])... See pokeheartgold src/battle/battle_system.c line 336 onwards

Will need future testing once implemented: Purify, Gmax Sweetness, Lunar Blessing, Jungle Healing,

Out of scope: Increased chance of application in snow, increased effect chance compared to freeze, increased move power compared to freeze, thawing, PLA move effects (bleakwind storm, bitter malice)
